## Description

Implement comprehensive test coverage for the executor module (`clustrix/executor.py`) focusing on job lifecycle management, SSH connections, and file transfers. The current coverage is 71% and needs to reach 85%+ by testing job submission, monitoring, and result collection workflows.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Test coverage for `clustrix/executor.py` reaches 85%+
- [ ] Job lifecycle testing (submit → monitor → collect results)
- [ ] SSH connection management testing with paramiko mocking
- [ ] File transfer operations testing (upload/download via SFTP)
- [ ] Job status monitoring for all cluster types (SLURM, PBS, SGE, Kubernetes, SSH)
- [ ] Error handling for connection failures and timeouts
- [ ] Remote environment setup and cleanup testing
- [ ] Result serialization and deserialization testing
- [ ] All tests pass in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] No reduction in existing test coverage for other modules

## Technical Details

### Current Coverage Analysis
- **File**: `clustrix/executor.py`
- **Current**: 71% coverage
- **Target**: 85%+ coverage
- **Focus**: Job execution workflow and SSH operations

### Key Areas to Test

1. **Job Lifecycle Management**
   - Job submission to different cluster types
   - Job status polling and monitoring
   - Result collection and cleanup
   - Error propagation from remote execution

2. **SSH Connection Management**
   - Connection establishment with paramiko
   - Connection pooling and reuse
   - Authentication (key-based and password)
   - Connection failure and retry logic

3. **File Transfer Operations**
   - SFTP upload of serialized functions and data
   - Remote directory creation and management
   - Download of results and logs
   - File permission and cleanup handling

4. **Cluster-Specific Operations**
   - SLURM job submission and monitoring
   - PBS/SGE scheduler integration
   - Kubernetes pod management
   - SSH-only execution mode

5. **Error Scenarios**
   - Network connectivity issues
   - Authentication failures
   - Remote execution errors
   - Timeout handling

### Testing Strategy
- Mock paramiko SSH/SFTP operations for predictable testing
- Use temporary directories for file operation testing
- Mock cluster scheduler commands (sbatch, qsub, kubectl)
- Test concurrent job execution scenarios
- Verify proper resource cleanup in all error paths

## Dependencies

- paramiko library for SSH operations
- pytest and pytest-mock for testing framework
- tempfile for temporary directory testing
- Access to existing executor implementation

## Effort Estimate

**Size: M (3-4 days)**

- **Research**: 0.5 days (understand current executor implementation)
- **Test Design**: 0.5 days (plan SSH mocking and job lifecycle tests)
- **Implementation**: 2-2.5 days (write comprehensive executor tests)
- **Validation**: 0.5-1 day (verify coverage and CI integration)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Executor module test coverage ≥ 85%
- [ ] Job lifecycle fully tested for all cluster types
- [ ] SSH connection and file transfer operations covered
- [ ] Error handling and edge cases tested
- [ ] All tests pass locally and in CI
- [ ] No regression in other module coverage
- [ ] Code review completed and approved
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed
