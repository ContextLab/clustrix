## Description

Implement comprehensive test coverage for the AWS provider module (`clustrix/providers/aws.py`) with focus on EKS, EC2, and IAM operations. The current coverage is 48% (291 lines, 151 missing) and needs to reach 85%+ coverage using boto3 stubber for AWS API mocking.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Test coverage for `clustrix/providers/aws.py` reaches 85%+ (reduce missing lines from 151 to <44)
- [ ] All EKS operations tested (cluster creation, job submission, status checking)
- [ ] All EC2 operations tested (instance management, security groups, key pairs)
- [ ] All IAM operations tested (role creation, policy attachment, service accounts)
- [ ] Use boto3 stubber for consistent AWS API mocking (no real AWS calls)
- [ ] Test error handling for AWS API failures and rate limiting
- [ ] Test credential handling and region configuration
- [ ] All tests pass in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] No reduction in existing test coverage for other modules

## Technical Details

### Current Coverage Analysis
- **File**: `clustrix/providers/aws.py`
- **Current**: 48% coverage (140/291 lines)
- **Missing**: 151 lines need coverage
- **Target**: 85%+ coverage (<44 missing lines)

### Key Areas to Test

1. **EKS Operations**
   - Cluster creation and configuration
   - Job submission to Kubernetes
   - Pod status monitoring
   - Resource cleanup

2. **EC2 Operations**
   - Instance lifecycle management
   - Security group configuration
   - Key pair management
   - Subnet and VPC handling

3. **IAM Operations**
   - Service role creation
   - Policy attachment and permissions
   - Service account management
   - Cross-service role assumptions

4. **Error Scenarios**
   - AWS API rate limiting
   - Credential expiration
   - Resource not found errors
   - Permission denied scenarios

### Testing Strategy
- Use `boto3` stubber for predictable AWS API responses
- Test both success and failure scenarios
- Mock AWS credentials and regions consistently
- Verify proper resource cleanup in all paths

## Dependencies

- boto3 and botocore (AWS SDK)
- pytest and pytest-mock
- moto library for additional AWS mocking if needed
- Access to existing AWS provider code structure

## Effort Estimate

**Size: L (5-7 days)**

- **Research**: 1 day (understand current AWS provider implementation)
- **Test Design**: 1 day (plan test structure and boto3 stubber usage)  
- **Implementation**: 3-4 days (write comprehensive tests)
- **Validation**: 1 day (verify coverage targets and CI integration)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] AWS provider test coverage â‰¥ 85%
- [ ] All AWS service operations have test coverage
- [ ] boto3 stubber used consistently for API mocking
- [ ] Tests cover both success and error scenarios
- [ ] All tests pass locally and in CI
- [ ] No regression in other module coverage
- [ ] Code review completed and approved
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed
