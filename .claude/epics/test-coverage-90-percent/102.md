## Description

Implement comprehensive testing for Jupyter notebook integration, magic commands, and interactive features. The current notebook functionality has significant coverage gaps (50% coverage, 621 missing lines out of 1,236 total) and needs robust testing to ensure reliability in interactive environments.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Achieve 85%+ test coverage for notebook-related modules
- [ ] Test all magic commands (%%cluster, %cluster_status, etc.)
- [ ] Verify interactive execution paths work correctly
- [ ] Test notebook cell output capture and display
- [ ] Validate IPython kernel integration
- [ ] Test error handling in notebook contexts
- [ ] Ensure compatibility across Jupyter Lab, Notebook, and VS Code
- [ ] Test variable persistence between cells
- [ ] Validate display of execution progress and results

## Technical Details

### Key Areas to Test

**Magic Commands**:
- `%%cluster` cell magic functionality
- `%cluster_status` line magic
- Parameter parsing and validation
- Error reporting in notebook cells

**IPython Integration**:
- Kernel communication protocols
- Display system integration
- Progress reporting mechanisms
- Exception handling in interactive contexts

**Testing Approach**:
- Use IPython testing utilities (`IPython.testing.tools`)
- Mock notebook environment contexts
- Test with synthetic notebook cells
- Validate output formatting and display

### Test Structure
```python
# Use IPython's testing framework
from IPython.testing import tools as tt
from IPython.core.magic import register_cell_magic, register_line_magic

def test_cluster_cell_magic():
    # Test %%cluster magic command
    with tt.mocked_import('clustrix.notebook'):
        # Test implementation
        pass

def test_interactive_execution():
    # Test execution in notebook context
    pass
```

### Coverage Targets
- Current: ~50% (615/1,236 lines covered)
- Target: 85%+ (1,050+ lines covered)
- Focus on magic command registration, execution paths, and error handling

## Dependencies

- **Technical**: IPython testing framework, jupyter testing utilities
- **Logical**: Can run independently of other test coverage tasks
- **Resources**: None (can run in parallel)

## Effort Estimate

**Size**: L (5-6 days)

**Breakdown**:
- Day 1: Setup IPython testing framework, understand current magic commands
- Day 2-3: Test magic command registration and basic functionality
- Day 4: Test interactive execution paths and variable persistence  
- Day 5: Test error handling and edge cases in notebook contexts
- Day 6: Coverage validation and cleanup

**Complexity**: High - requires deep understanding of IPython/Jupyter internals

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All magic commands have comprehensive test coverage
- [ ] Interactive execution paths are tested with real notebook scenarios
- [ ] Error handling is validated in notebook contexts
- [ ] Coverage reports show 85%+ for notebook-related modules
- [ ] Tests run reliably in CI environment
- [ ] Documentation updated with testing approach for notebook features
- [ ] No regressions in existing functionality
