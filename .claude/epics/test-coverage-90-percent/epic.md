# Epic: Achieve 90% Test Coverage

## Overview

Systematically increase test coverage from 74% to 90% by targeting high-impact modules with comprehensive test suites. Focus on AWS provider integration, core execution engine, and notebook magic functionality while maintaining code quality and performance standards.

## Architecture Decisions

- **Testing Framework**: Continue using pytest with coverage reporting
- **Mocking Strategy**: Use boto3 stubber for AWS APIs, IPython utilities for notebook testing
- **Coverage Tooling**: Leverage existing coverage.py integration with pytest
- **Quality Gates**: Maintain existing pre-commit hooks (black, flake8, mypy)
- **Performance Targets**: <5min local test execution, <15min CI pipeline

## Technical Approach

### Backend Services
- **AWS Provider Module**: Comprehensive EKS, EC2, and IAM operation testing
- **Executor Engine**: Job submission, monitoring, and result collection testing
- **Loop Analysis**: AST parsing and parallelization strategy testing
- **Utility Functions**: Serialization, environment capture, and job script testing

### Frontend Components
- **Notebook Magic**: Jupyter integration and magic command testing
- **Interactive Features**: Progress indicators, result visualization testing
- **User Interface**: Error handling and validation testing

### Infrastructure
- **CI/CD Integration**: Coverage reporting in GitHub Actions
- **Test Performance**: Parallel execution and efficient mocking
- **Quality Assurance**: Automated coverage tracking and reporting

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase-Based Approach
1. **AWS Provider Focus** (Week 1-2): Target highest-impact module (291 lines, 151 missing)
2. **Core Engine Testing** (Week 2-3): Executor, loop analysis, and utilities
3. **Notebook Integration** (Week 3-4): Magic commands and Jupyter functionality
4. **Coverage Optimization** (Week 4): Gap analysis and final push to 90%

### Risk Mitigation
- **Complex APIs**: Use established AWS Cloud Control API patterns
- **Environment Testing**: Mock notebook context rather than full Jupyter simulation
- **Performance Impact**: Implement parallel test execution and efficient mocking

### Testing Approach
- **Unit Testing**: Focus on individual function and class testing
- **Integration Testing**: Test component interactions and workflows
- **Mock-Based Testing**: Avoid real API calls while maintaining test realism
- **Error Scenario Testing**: Comprehensive edge case and failure mode coverage

## Task Breakdown Preview

High-level task categories that will be created:
- [ ] **AWS Provider Comprehensive Testing**: EKS, EC2, IAM operations with boto3 stubber (48% → 85%+)
- [ ] **Executor Module Testing**: Job lifecycle, SSH connections, file transfers (71% → 85%+)
- [ ] **Loop Analysis Testing**: AST parsing, parallelization detection (72% → 85%+)
- [ ] **Utils Module Testing**: Serialization, environment capture, job scripts (70% → 85%+)
- [ ] **Notebook Magic Testing**: Jupyter integration, magic commands (50% → 85%+)
- [ ] **Error Handling & Edge Cases**: Comprehensive failure scenario testing
- [ ] **Performance & Quality**: Test execution optimization and coverage reporting
- [ ] **Coverage Gap Analysis**: Identify and address remaining uncovered lines

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- **boto3 stubber**: AWS API mocking capabilities
- **IPython testing utilities**: Notebook environment simulation
- **pytest ecosystem**: Coverage reporting and test execution
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline integration

### Internal Dependencies
- **Existing test infrastructure**: Build upon current pytest setup
- **Code quality tools**: Integration with black, flake8, mypy
- **Coverage reporting**: Extend existing coverage.py configuration

### Prerequisite Work
- Current test suite must remain stable (no regressions)
- Pre-commit hooks must continue functioning
- CI/CD pipeline must maintain performance

## Success Criteria (Technical)

### Performance Benchmarks
- **Local test execution**: <5 minutes total
- **CI pipeline**: <15 minutes including coverage reporting
- **Individual tests**: <30 seconds maximum execution time
- **Memory usage**: Efficient resource utilization during test runs

### Quality Gates
- **Coverage target**: ≥90% overall (from current 74%)
- **Module targets**: Each priority module ≥85% coverage
- **Code quality**: 100% pass rate for black, flake8, mypy
- **Test reliability**: Zero flaky tests, deterministic results

### Acceptance Criteria
- **No test regressions**: All existing tests continue passing
- **Pattern consistency**: New tests follow established conventions
- **Documentation**: Clear test documentation and naming
- **Error validation**: Comprehensive user-facing error message testing

## Estimated Effort

### Overall Timeline
- **Total Duration**: 3-4 weeks
- **Resource Requirements**: 1 developer, full-time focus
- **Weekly Milestones**: Clear deliverables and coverage improvements

### Critical Path Items
1. **AWS Provider Testing** (Week 1-2): Highest impact, most complex APIs
2. **Notebook Magic Testing** (Week 3-4): Largest codebase section
3. **Coverage Gap Analysis** (Week 4): Final optimization and validation

### Effort Distribution
- **AWS Provider**: 40% of effort (highest complexity, impact)
- **Notebook Magic**: 35% of effort (largest codebase section)
- **Core Modules**: 20% of effort (executor, loop analysis, utils)
- **Final Optimization**: 5% of effort (gap analysis, reporting)
