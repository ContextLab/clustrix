## Description

Implement comprehensive test coverage for the utils module (`clustrix/utils.py`) focusing on serialization, environment capture, and job script generation. The current coverage is 70% and needs to reach 85%+ by testing function serialization, utility functions, and cluster-specific job script creation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Test coverage for `clustrix/utils.py` reaches 85%+
- [ ] Function serialization/deserialization tested with cloudpickle and dill
- [ ] Environment capture and replication testing
- [ ] Job script generation tested for all cluster types
- [ ] Utility function edge cases and error handling tested
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility testing where applicable
- [ ] Performance testing for large serialization operations
- [ ] All tests pass in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] No reduction in existing test coverage for other modules

## Technical Details

### Current Coverage Analysis
- **File**: `clustrix/utils.py`
- **Current**: 70% coverage
- **Target**: 85%+ coverage
- **Focus**: Serialization, environment management, job scripts

### Key Areas to Test

1. **Function Serialization**
   - cloudpickle serialization of various function types
   - dill fallback serialization testing
   - Lambda function handling
   - Closure and nested function serialization
   - Class method and static method handling

2. **Environment Capture and Replication**
   - pip freeze output capture
   - conda environment detection
   - Virtual environment handling
   - Package dependency resolution
   - Cross-platform environment differences

3. **Job Script Generation**
   - SLURM job script creation
   - PBS/SGE script templates
   - Kubernetes manifest generation
   - SSH-based execution scripts
   - Resource requirement specification

4. **Utility Functions**
   - File path manipulation
   - String processing utilities
   - Configuration parsing helpers
   - Error formatting and logging

5. **Edge Cases and Error Handling**
   - Serialization failures
   - Missing dependencies
   - Invalid job parameters
   - Platform-specific issues

### Testing Strategy
- Test serialization with diverse function types and closures
- Mock system environment for predictable testing
- Generate and validate job scripts for each cluster type
- Test cross-platform behavior with path operations
- Verify error handling and fallback mechanisms

## Dependencies

- cloudpickle and dill for serialization testing
- pytest and pytest-mock for testing framework
- tempfile for temporary file operations
- sys and os modules for environment testing
- Access to existing utils implementation

## Effort Estimate

**Size: S (2-3 days)**

- **Research**: 0.5 days (understand current utils implementation)
- **Test Design**: 0.5 days (plan serialization and job script tests)
- **Implementation**: 1-1.5 days (write comprehensive utils tests)
- **Validation**: 0.5 days (verify coverage and cross-platform compatibility)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Utils module test coverage â‰¥ 85%
- [ ] Function serialization thoroughly tested with multiple scenarios
- [ ] Environment capture and job script generation covered
- [ ] Utility functions and error handling tested
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility verified where applicable
- [ ] All tests pass locally and in CI
- [ ] No regression in other module coverage
- [ ] Code review completed and approved
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed
