## Description

Implement comprehensive test coverage for the loop analysis functionality focused on AST parsing and parallelization detection. The current coverage is 72% and needs to reach 85%+ by testing various code patterns, nested structures, and edge cases in loop detection.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Test coverage for loop analysis code reaches 85%+
- [ ] AST parsing tested for various Python loop constructs
- [ ] Parallelization detection tested for different loop patterns
- [ ] Nested loop and complex control flow testing
- [ ] Edge cases and invalid syntax handling tested
- [ ] Loop variable dependency analysis tested
- [ ] Performance testing for large code structures
- [ ] All tests pass in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] No reduction in existing test coverage for other modules

## Technical Details

### Current Coverage Analysis
- **Focus Areas**: AST-based loop detection and analysis
- **Current**: 72% coverage
- **Target**: 85%+ coverage
- **Key Files**: Loop analysis utilities in `clustrix/utils.py` or dedicated modules

### Key Areas to Test

1. **AST Parsing and Analysis**
   - Basic for/while loop detection
   - List comprehension analysis
   - Generator expression handling
   - Complex nested structures

2. **Loop Pattern Recognition**
   - Simple iteration patterns
   - Nested loop structures
   - Loop with conditional breaks/continues
   - Multiple loop variables

3. **Parallelization Detection**
   - Independent loop iterations
   - Data dependency analysis
   - Shared variable detection
   - Side effect identification

4. **Code Pattern Variations**
   - Different loop syntaxes (for, while, comprehensions)
   - Function calls within loops
   - Exception handling in loops
   - Class method iteration patterns

5. **Edge Cases**
   - Malformed or incomplete code
   - Very large code structures
   - Deeply nested loops
   - Dynamic loop construction

### Testing Strategy
- Create comprehensive test code samples with known loop patterns
- Test AST parsing on various Python syntax constructs
- Verify parallelization decisions match expected outcomes
- Test performance with large and complex code structures
- Use ast module features for generating test cases

## Dependencies

- Python ast module for AST manipulation
- pytest for testing framework
- Sample code generators for comprehensive test coverage
- Access to existing loop analysis implementation

## Effort Estimate

**Size: S (2-3 days)**

- **Research**: 0.5 days (understand current loop analysis implementation)
- **Test Design**: 0.5 days (plan AST test cases and code patterns)
- **Implementation**: 1-1.5 days (write comprehensive loop analysis tests)
- **Validation**: 0.5 days (verify coverage and edge case handling)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Loop analysis test coverage â‰¥ 85%
- [ ] AST parsing tested for all supported loop types
- [ ] Parallelization detection accuracy verified
- [ ] Edge cases and error conditions covered
- [ ] Performance tested with large code samples
- [ ] All tests pass locally and in CI
- [ ] No regression in other module coverage
- [ ] Code review completed and approved
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed
