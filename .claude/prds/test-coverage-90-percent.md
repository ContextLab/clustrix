**Issue**: #61  
**Status**: Open  
**Priority**: High  
**Assignee**: TBD  
**Estimated Timeline**: 3-4 weeks  

## Executive Summary

Clustrix currently has 74% test coverage (3,769/5,116 lines covered). This PRD outlines the plan to systematically increase test coverage to 90%, focusing on the highest-impact modules while maintaining code quality and reliability. The effort will enhance the project's stability, reduce bugs in production, and improve developer confidence.
