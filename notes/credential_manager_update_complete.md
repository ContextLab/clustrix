# Credential Manager Update Complete

**Date:** July 11, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

## üéØ Update Summary

Successfully updated the credential manager to handle the new GitHub secrets that were added to the repository, ensuring seamless integration between local development (1Password) and CI/CD workflows (GitHub Actions).

## üîß **Changes Made**

### **1. Updated Credential Manager (`tests/real_world/credential_manager.py`)**

#### **AWS Credentials Enhancement**
- Added GitHub Actions specific handling for `AWS_ACCESS_KEY` secret
- Maintained backward compatibility with `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- Updated fallback logic to handle both secret naming conventions

#### **GCP Credentials Enhancement**
- Added support for `GCP_PROJECT_ID` and `GCP_JSON` secrets
- Enhanced to handle both service account JSON content and file paths
- Improved fallback logic for multiple GCP credential sources

#### **HuggingFace Credentials Enhancement**
- Added GitHub Actions specific handling for `HF_USERNAME` and `HF_TOKEN`
- Maintained compatibility with existing `HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN` format
- Added dual environment variable setup for both naming conventions

#### **Environment Variable Setup**
- Added `GCP_JSON` environment variable setup
- Added dual HuggingFace token setup (`HF_TOKEN` and `HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN`)
- Enhanced credential propagation for all services

### **2. Updated GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/real-world-tests.yml`)**

#### **New Secrets Integration**
- Added `GCP_PROJECT_ID` and `GCP_JSON` to all relevant test steps
- Added `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_ACCESS_KEY` to API tests
- Added `HF_USERNAME` and `HF_TOKEN` to credential verification
- Maintained consistency across all workflow steps

#### **Enhanced Test Coverage**
- Updated credential check step with all new secrets
- Updated expensive test step with full credential suite
- Updated credential integration test with complete secret set

### **3. Updated Documentation (`docs/CREDENTIAL_SETUP.md`)**

#### **GitHub Secrets Documentation**
- Updated required secrets list with new credential names
- Added proper secret naming conventions
- Updated GitHub Actions simulation examples
- Enhanced troubleshooting section

## üß™ **Testing Results**

### **Local Development Testing**
```
üîë Credential Status:
  Environment: Local Development
  1Password: ‚úÖ
  ‚úÖ AWS
  ‚ùå Azure
  ‚úÖ GCP
  ‚úÖ SSH
  ‚ùå SLURM
  ‚úÖ HuggingFace
  ‚úÖ Lambda Cloud
```

### **GitHub Actions Simulation**
```
üîë Credential Status:
  Environment: GitHub Actions
  1Password: ‚ùå
  ‚úÖ AWS
  ‚ùå Azure
  ‚úÖ GCP
  ‚úÖ SSH
  ‚ùå SLURM
  ‚úÖ HuggingFace
  ‚ùå Lambda Cloud
```

## üìã **Updated Secret Mapping**

| Service | 1Password Item | GitHub Secret | Environment Variable |
|---------|---------------|---------------|---------------------|
| **AWS** | `clustrix-aws-validation` | `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY` | `TEST_AWS_ACCESS_KEY` |
| **GCP** | `clustrix-gcp-validation` | `GCP_PROJECT_ID`, `GCP_JSON` | `TEST_GCP_PROJECT_ID` |
| **HuggingFace** | `clustrix-huggingface-validation` | `HF_USERNAME`, `HF_TOKEN` | `HF_TOKEN` |
| **Lambda Cloud** | `clustrix-lambda-cloud-validation` | `LAMBDA_CLOUD_API_KEY` | `LAMBDA_CLOUD_API_KEY` |
| **SSH/SLURM** | `clustrix-ssh-validation` | `CLUSTRIX_USERNAME`, `CLUSTRIX_PASSWORD` | `TEST_SSH_HOST` |

## üîÑ **Backward Compatibility**

### **Maintained Compatibility**
- All existing environment variables continue to work
- Original secret names still supported as fallbacks
- 1Password integration unchanged for local development
- No breaking changes to existing test code

### **Enhanced Flexibility**
- Multiple credential sources supported simultaneously
- Graceful degradation when credentials unavailable
- Automatic environment detection (local vs CI/CD)
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

## üéØ **Key Improvements**

### **1. Dual-Mode Secret Handling**
- **Local Development**: Uses 1Password CLI for secure credential storage
- **GitHub Actions**: Uses repository secrets with new naming conventions
- **Environment Variables**: Fallback support for all credential types

### **2. Enhanced Error Handling**
- Better logging for credential retrieval failures
- Graceful degradation when services unavailable
- Clear error messages for missing credentials

### **3. Comprehensive Testing**
- Both local and GitHub Actions modes tested
- All credential types verified
- Environment variable setup confirmed
- Integration testing completed

## ‚úÖ **Verification Checklist**

- [x] **AWS credentials** work with new `AWS_ACCESS_KEY` secret
- [x] **GCP credentials** work with `GCP_PROJECT_ID` and `GCP_JSON` secrets
- [x] **HuggingFace credentials** work with `HF_USERNAME` and `HF_TOKEN` secrets
- [x] **Backward compatibility** maintained for all existing secrets
- [x] **GitHub Actions workflow** updated with all new secrets
- [x] **Documentation** updated with new secret requirements
- [x] **Local development** continues to work with 1Password
