## Feature Description
<!-- Provide a clear and concise description of the feature you'd like to see -->

## Use Case
<!-- Describe the problem this feature would solve or the use case it enables -->

## Motivation
<!-- Why is this feature needed? What pain point does it address? -->

## Proposed Solution
<!-- Describe how you envision this feature working -->

### User Experience
<!-- How would users interact with this feature? -->
```python
# Example of how the feature would be used
@cluster(new_feature=True)
def example_function():
    pass
```

### Expected Behavior
<!-- What should happen when this feature is used? -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- Define specific, measurable criteria for when this feature is complete -->

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] **Requirement 1**: <!-- e.g., Support for GPU resource specification -->
- [ ] **Requirement 2**: <!-- e.g., Integration with SLURM GPU scheduling -->
- [ ] **Requirement 3**: <!-- e.g., Automatic GPU detection on remote clusters -->

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] **Performance**: <!-- e.g., Feature should not add more than 10% overhead -->
- [ ] **Compatibility**: <!-- e.g., Must work with Python 3.8+ -->
- [ ] **Documentation**: <!-- e.g., Include tutorial and API documentation -->
- [ ] **Testing**: <!-- e.g., Unit tests with >90% coverage, integration tests -->

### Technical Specifications
- [ ] **API Design**: <!-- e.g., New decorator parameters or configuration options -->
- [ ] **Backend Support**: <!-- e.g., Which cluster types should support this feature -->
- [ ] **Error Handling**: <!-- e.g., Graceful degradation when feature unavailable -->
- [ ] **Security**: <!-- e.g., No sensitive information exposed in logs -->

## Cluster Compatibility
<!-- Which cluster types should support this feature? -->
- [ ] SLURM
- [ ] PBS
- [ ] SGE
- [ ] Kubernetes
- [ ] SSH
- [ ] Local execution

## Examples and Mockups
<!-- Provide concrete examples of how this feature would work -->

### Basic Usage Example
```python
# Simple example
@cluster(your_feature_here=True)
def my_function():
    return "Hello from cluster"
```

### Advanced Usage Example
```python
# More complex example
@cluster(
    your_feature_here={
        'option1': 'value1',
        'option2': 'value2'
    }
)
def advanced_function(data):
    # Feature-specific functionality
    return processed_data
```

### Configuration Example
```python
# If feature requires configuration
clustrix.configure(
    feature_config={
        'setting1': 'value1',
        'setting2': 'value2'
    }
)
```
