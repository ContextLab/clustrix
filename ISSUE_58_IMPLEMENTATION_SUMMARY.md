### Basic Cost Estimation
```python

# Initialize with API pricing
monitor = LambdaCostMonitor(use_pricing_api=True, api_key="your-api-key")

# Get cost estimate
cost_estimate = monitor.estimate_cost("gpu_1x_a10", 4.0)  # 4 hours
print(f"Estimated cost: ${cost_estimate.estimated_cost:.2f}")
print(f"Pricing source: {cost_estimate.pricing_source}")
```

### Cross-Provider Comparison
```python
from clustrix.cost_providers.aws import AWSCostMonitor
from clustrix.cost_providers.lambda_cloud import LambdaCostMonitor

# Compare GPU costs
aws_monitor = AWSCostMonitor()
lambda_monitor = LambdaCostMonitor(use_pricing_api=True)

aws_cost = aws_monitor.estimate_cost("g4dn.xlarge", 4.0)
lambda_cost = lambda_monitor.estimate_cost("gpu_1x_a10", 4.0)

print(f"AWS g4dn.xlarge: ${aws_cost.estimated_cost:.2f}")
print(f"Lambda A10: ${lambda_cost.estimated_cost:.2f}")
```

### Production Monitoring Setup
