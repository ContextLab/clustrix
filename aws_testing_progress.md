# AWS EKS Testing Progress Report

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. ✅ 1Password Popup Issue
**Problem**: Credential manager was checking 1Password first, causing authentication popups
**Solution**: Reordered priority to check 1Password last
**Status**: FIXED

### 2. ✅ AWS IAM Permissions
**Problem**: AWS managed EKS policies don't grant user permissions (only service role permissions)
**Solution**: Added custom inline policy with `eks:*` permissions
**Status**: FIXED

### 3. ✅ NAT Gateway Bottleneck
**Problem**: NAT gateways take 5-10 minutes to provision and cost $0.045/hour each
**Solution**: Created optimized provisioning that uses public subnets only for testing
**Status**: FIXED with workaround

## Current Test Status

### Running Test: Optimized EKS Provisioning
- **Cluster Name**: optimized-1755881174
- **Started**: 2025-08-22 12:46:14
- **Current Stage**: Waiting for EKS cluster to be active
- **Expected Duration**: 10-15 minutes total

### Resources Created
- ✅ VPC: Created (10.0.0.0/16)
- ✅ Subnets: 2 public subnets in different AZs
- ✅ Internet Gateway: Attached
- ✅ Security Groups: Created
- ✅ IAM Roles: Cluster and node roles created
- ⏳ EKS Cluster: Creating (takes 10-15 minutes)
- ⏳ Node Groups: Pending (after cluster is active)

## Cost Analysis

### Per Hour Costs
- EKS Control Plane: $0.10/hour
- t3.micro instance: $0.0104/hour (if using for nodes)
- NAT Gateway: $0.045/hour each (SKIPPED in optimized version)
- Data Transfer: ~$0.01/hour

### Optimized Test Cost
- ~$0.11/hour (without NAT gateways)
- Original estimate was $0.28/hour (with NAT gateways)

## Key Learnings

1. **NAT Gateways are expensive and slow**
   - Take 5-10 minutes to provision
   - Cost $0.045/hour each
   - Not needed for testing if using public subnets

2. **AWS Managed Policies are misleading**
   - `AmazonEKSClusterPolicy` is for the EKS service, not users
   - Users need explicit `eks:*` permissions via custom policy

3. **EKS Cluster creation is slow**
   - Control plane takes 10-15 minutes
   - Node groups take additional 3-5 minutes
   - Total provisioning time: 15-20 minutes

## Next Steps

1. Wait for current test cluster to complete
2. Verify cluster is operational
3. Test job execution on the cluster
4. Destroy test resources
5. Apply learnings to other cloud providers
6. Update documentation with findings
